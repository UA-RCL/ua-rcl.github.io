  title: "CEDR: a Compiler-integrated Extensible DSSoC Runtime"
  description: >
    CEDR is an open-source, compiler-integrated, extensible DSSoC runtime that unifies a front-end compilation flow
    with a Linux-based runtime and intelligent scheduling framework. Applications are transformed into hardware-agnostic
    function calls, allowing the runtime to dynamically map tasks to the most suitable processing elements, enabling
    efficient resource utilization and productive deployment in heterogeneous systems.

  title: "RANC: Reconfigurable Architecture for Neuromorphic Computing"
  description: >
    RANC is a highly flexible environment that enables rapid experimentation with neuromorphic architectures in both
    software via C++ simulation and hardware via FPGA emulation. RANC enables hardware architects and application
    engineers to investigate and tune parameters of their neuromorphic architecture that would otherwise be unavailable
    on a purely prefabricated ASIC.

  title: "K-PACT: Kernel Planning for Adaptive Context Switching"
  description: >
    K-PACT is a software planning framework that clusters temporally independent kernels and places them onto
    reconfigurable hardware equipped with multiple IMEM banks, enabling nanosecond-scale context switching without
    requiring full hardware reconfiguration. This capability is particularly critical for dynamic workloads, where rapid adaptation 
    and efficient reuse of resources are essential.
