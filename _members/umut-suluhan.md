I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at The University of Arizona. I received my BS degree in Computer Science from Ozyegin University in 2023. My research interests are broadly in high-performance computing and reconfigurable architectures. 

As my first research thrust, I am currently exploring heterogeneous computing systems, a field gaining traction in both academic and industrial settings. While heterogeneous systems offer performance advantages compared to homogeneous ones, they pose challenges in terms of user-friendliness and programmer efficiency. My research aims to create software abstractions to empower application engineers so that they can effortlessly deploy their applications on heterogeneous computing systems and enable system architects evaluate hardware compositions and rapidly converge to a desired configuration for the targeted domain of applications. 
As another research thrust, I am developing a planning tool for enabling adaptive computing in dynamic environments. My research is focused on reducing overheads in reconfigurable systems, enabling rapid context switching, and optimizing dataflow for workloads such as spectrum sensing and machine learning. More broadly, my goal is to build scalable frameworks that make future computing platforms responsive to real-time demands.
