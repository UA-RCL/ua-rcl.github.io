          <h2>About CEDR</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            System designers are continuously exploring design methodologies that harness increased levels of heterogeneity towards pushing the boundaries of achievable performance gains. 
            We have developed CEDR, an open-source, unified compilation, and runtime framework designed for heterogeneous systems, as part of the DARPA DSSoC program. CEDR allows 
            applications, scheduling heuristics, and accelerators to be co-designed in a cohesive manner. CEDR is currently being leveraged in basic research as part of the DARPA 
            SpaceBACN and PROWESS programs. Its utility has been successfully tested by our industry partners General Dynamics and Collins Aerospace with their applications along 
            with several academic partners and independently evaluated by the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute.
            We shared CEDR with the community by organizing tutorials in venues such as International Symposium on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (ISFPGA‚Äô24) and Embedded Systems Week, 
            Education Track (ESWEEK‚Äô23).  We showcased the utility of this framework through live demonstrations during Free and Open-source Software Developers‚Äô European Meeting 
            (FOSDEM‚Äô20 and ‚Äô21), GNU Radio 4.0 Hackfest (2020), GNU Radio Conference (2022), and Arm Research Summit (2019).

            <h2>Value based Runtime Management</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Value-based resource management heuristics, which are traditionally deployed in heterogeneous HPC systems, maximize system productivity by assigning resources to 
              each job based on its priority and estimated value gain relative to each job's completion time. We investigate the utility of value-based resource management at 
              heterogeneous SoC scale and demonstrate its ability to make effective scheduling decisions for time-constrained jobs in oversubscribed systems where system 
              resources are shared by multiple users and applications arrive dynamically. The proposed value-based resource management approach drops tasks that are estimated to
              result with lower-value gain dynamically with the aim of completing more number of high-value jobs with a scheduling decision time at 120ùúás scale. The 
              value-based resource management treats scheduling as a global optimization problem, therefore this study sets a path forward for deploying a unified value-based 
              resource management on a system composed of front-end SoC-based edge devices and a back-end HPC system.
            </p><br>

            <h2>Anomaly Detection on Heterogeneous SoC</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Distinguishing between normal and abnormal application behavior poses a greater challenge in heterogeneous computing systems compared to homogeneous systems due 
              to varying execution characteristics influenced by factors like differences in programming models, diversity of Processing Elements (PEs), and dynamically changing 
              resource allocation decisions. We develop a profiling framework integrated with an open-source runtime to understand the non-linear correlations among the 
              aforementioned factors. Using this framework as a foundation, we construct an autoencoder model that provides a holistic system view and achieves up to 19% 
              and 13% improvement in abnormal behavior detection accuracy compared to conventional methods such as the One-Class Support Vector Machine and Isolation Forest 
              respectively. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach by executing real-world applications covering radar, communications, and autonomous vehicles domains 
              along with anomalous application scenarios that manipulate behavior or the state of the runtime manager, scheduler, and PEs across three commercial off-the-shelf 
              platforms and three scheduling heuristic policies.

            <h2>RISC-V based Heterogeneous SoC Emulation Platform</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Heterogeneous System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures are becoming attractive for deployment in HPC environments as they deliver performance with energy efficiency 
              and scalability benefits. Particularly the RISC-V is an attractive solution for building heterogeneous systems at HPC scale since it offers ability to customize 
              CPU cores and modularity to integrate with other compute units towards meeting the demands of wide range of computational workloads. Consequently, there is a 
              need for a software ecosystem that facilitates productive application development and deployment on such heterogeneous SoCs, while utilizing system resources 
              effectively. We present a preliminary study over a runtime environment that allows execution of applications written in C/C++ on heterogeneous SoC architectures 
              composed of multiple RISC-V core types and a pool of accelerators emulated on Xilinx Virtex 7 FPGA.  We showcase ability to investigate the impact of hardware 
              composition and scheduling policy on execution time performance while executing real-life applications in our emulation environment. 
            </p><br>

            <h2>Automated PyTorch Application Deployment on Heterogeneous SoC</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              The PyTorch programming interface enables efficient deployment of machine learning models, leveraging the parallelism offered by GPU architectures. In this study, 
              we present the integration of the PyTorch framework with a compiler and runtime ecosystem. Our aim is to demonstrate the ability to deploy PyTorch-based models on 
              FPGA-based SoC platforms, without requiring users to possess prior FPGA-based design experience. The proposed PyTorch model transformation approach expands the 
              range of hardware architectures that PyTorch developers can target, enabling them to take advantage of the energy-efficient execution provided by heterogeneous 
              computing systems. Our experiments involve compiling and executing real-life applications on heterogeneous SoC configurations emulated on the Xilinx Zynq 
              Ultrascale+ ZCU102 system. We showcase our ability to deploy three distinct PyTorch applications, encompassing object detection, visual geometry group (VGG), 
              and speech classification, using the integrated compiler and runtime system without loss of model accuracy. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by evaluating 
              dynamically arriving workload scenarios, consisting of a mix of PyTorch models and non-PyTorch-based applications. Through these experiments, we vary the hardware 
              composition and scheduling heuristics. Our findings indicate that when PyTorch-based applications coexist with unrelated applications, our integrated scheduler 
              fairly dispatches tasks to the FPGA platform's accelerator and CPU cores, without compromising the target throughput for each application.
