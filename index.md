## News

### Published papers, awards (like Maisha got), we should discuss about what we will migrate from the other website

1. Our paper CEDR-API: Productive, Performant Programming of Domain-Specific Embedded Systems (arXiv) was accepted to the 2023 IPDPS Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop.
2. Our paper CEDR -- A Compiler-Integrated, Extensible, DSSoC Runtime (arXiv, ACM) was accepted for publication in the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems.
3. Our paper User-Space Emulation Framework for Domain-Specific SoC Design (arXiv, IEEE Xplore) was accepted to the 2020 IPDPS Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop.

- We presented Automating Programming and Development of Heterogeneous SoCs with LLVM Tools at the 2020 Free and Open Source Developers' European Meetup (FOSDEM 2020).
- We presented a poster on Heterogeneous SoC Design Space Exploration with an FPGA based Emulation Framework at the 2019 International Conference on ReConFigurable Computing and FPGAs (ReConFig 2019).
- We presented a poster and demo on Emulation Framework for Hardware-Software Co-Design of Heterogeneous SoCs at 2019 ARM Research Summit.
