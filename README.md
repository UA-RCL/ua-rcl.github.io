## Test changes with Docker

It is recommended to use the provided Docker configuration with this repo to start a local server, and test out how the changes reflect on the webpage, before pushing to github. Follow the steps below:
1. Download and install docker for your OS distribution. ([Docker Install Page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)).
2. In the current repository directory, run `sudo bash .docker/run.sh`. This step sets up the docker and launches a server.
3. Once the docker sets up the server, user will get notification such as the following-

    <img src="./images/readme_scrsht_1.png" alt="scrsht" width="400">

4. Open the server address (`http://localhost:4000`) in the browser to view the webpage, and review the changes.

Any changes made in the sources while the server is running, prompts the docker to regenerate the website, which may take a few minutes to reflect in the browser.
